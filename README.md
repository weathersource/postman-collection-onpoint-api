# Using the OnPoint API with Postman

The [OnPointÂ® API](https://developer.weathersource.com/) by [Weather Source](https://weathersource.com/) provides hyper-local past, present & forecast weather data for business intelligence at global scale.

[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a powerful GUI platform for faster and easier API development.

## Configure an Environment

To use the OnPoint API collection in Postman, you need an OnPoint API Key. Get a free 30-day Developer Key at the [Weather Source Developer Portal](https://developer.weathersource.com/#developer-account-sign-up).

Once you have an OnPoint API Key, store it in a Postman environment variable named `onpoint_key`. Follow Postman's documentation to [set up an environment with variables](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments). The screenshot below shows a Postman environment configured with the `onpoint_key` variable.

## Using the OnPoint API Collection

View full documentation for the OnPoint API at the [Weather Source Developer Portal](https://developer.weathersource.com/documentation/).

The OnPoint API collection groups request types in the following folders:

* History
* Forecast
* Nowcast
* Climatology
* Astronomy
* Location Metadata

Each request type may query by Latitude/Longitude, Postal Code, Nielsen Designated Marketing Area, or OnPoint ID. History, Forecast, Nowcast, and Climatology also have geospatial data in GeoJSON, SHP, GeoTIFF, and PNG formats.

Open a folder and select a request. This screenshot shows the History Postal Code request.

Page description (yellow) and parameter descriptions (green) provide limited documentation for the selected request. Detailed resource documentation is available at the [Weather Source Developer Portal](https://developer.weathersource.com/documentation/resources/).

The request URL (red) contains variables (in addition to `onpoint_key`). In this example, `postal_code`, `country`, and `format` should be replaced with values of your choosing. By default, values are set to `22222`, `us`, and `json` respectively.

Submit the request.
